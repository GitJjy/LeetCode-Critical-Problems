/**
Given an array of integers, every element appears twice except for one. Find that single one.
Note:
Your algorithm should have a linear runtime complexity. Could you implement it without using extra memory?

// Here is an excellent solution:
int singleNumber(vector<int>& nums) {
        int len = nums.size();
        if (!len)
            return 0;
        int res = nums[0];
        for(int i = 1; i < len; ++i){
            res ^= nums[i]; // xor operator that make the couple numbers zero, left single number alone
        }
        return res;
    }
