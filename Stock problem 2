//** leetcode problem 122
// The same as stock problem 1 except you may complete as many transactions as you like
// However, you may not engage in multiple transactions at the same time
// (ie, you must sell the stock before you buy again).

//* Here are the simple approach I've learned
class Solution {
public:
    int maxProfit(vector<int>& prices) {
        int res = 0;
        for(int i = 1; i < prices.size(); i++)
            res += max(prices[i] - prices[i - 1], 0);
        return res;
    }
};

// This approach focuses on the target.
// The basic time unit is i and i + 1
