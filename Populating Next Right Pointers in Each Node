## LeetCode 
## 116. Populating Next Right Pointers in Each Node
/**** Given a binary tree

    struct TreeLinkNode {
      TreeLinkNode *left;
      TreeLinkNode *right;
      TreeLinkNode *next;
    }
Populate each next pointer to point to its next right node. If there is no next right node, the next pointer should be set to NULL.

Initially, all next pointers are set to NULL.

Note:

You may only use constant extra space.
You may assume that it is a perfect binary tree (ie, all leaves are at the same level, and every parent has two children).

Here are the two-pointer iterative solution:

void connect(TreeLinkNode *root) {
        if(root == NULL)
            return;
        TreeLinkNode *pre = root;
        TreeLinkNode *cur = NULL;
        while(pre->left != NULL)
        {
            cur = pre;
            while(cur != NULL)  // iterate in current level
            {
                cur->left->next = cur->right; // deal with leftChild and rightChild 
                if(cur->next != NULL)
                    cur->right->next = cur->next->left;
                cur = cur->next;
            }
            pre = pre->left;  // record level
        }
    }
  
  
  
  The following code are the ordinary version(given an ordinary binary tree):
  void connect(TreeLinkNode *root) {
        if(root != NULL)
        {
            TreeLinkNode *pre = root;   //  the first non-empty node in the next level
            TreeLinkNode *cur = NULL;   //  the current node to link its children 
            TreeLinkNode *curLink = NULL;   //  current node to populate the next pointer
            while(pre != NULL)
            {
                cur = pre;
                curLink = NULL;
                pre = NULL;
                while(cur != NULL)
                {
                    if(cur->left != NULL)
                    {
                        if(curLink == NULL)
                        {   curLink = cur->left;
                            pre = curLink;
                        }
                        else
                        {
                            curLink->next = cur->left;
                            curLink = curLink->next;
                        }
                        if(cur->right != NULL)
                        {
                            curLink->next = cur->right;
                            curLink = curLink->next;
                        } 
                    }
                    else 
                    {
                        if(cur->right != NULL)
                        {
                            if(curLink == NULL)
                            {
                                curLink = cur->right;
                                pre = curLink;
                            } 
                            else
                            {
                                curLink->next = cur->right;
                                curLink = curLink->next;
                            }
                        }
                    }
                    
                    cur = cur->next;
                }
            }
        } 
    }
